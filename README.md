# gamblingproject


Welcome! This a web application that was built to assess a person's tendency to be a compulsive gambler. 

## Description

In order to access the project, you must cd into our project folder titled "final project". Once you are there, you will have to type
the command "flask run" into the command line in order to start the project, since our project was made using flask. Once "flask run"
is typed into the command line, the program should start running, and then a link should pop up. Click that link to enter the website
that we built. Once you enter the website, you should see a website called "Gambling Successfully", where there should be a page with
animated slot machines as a background, a menu at the top of the page with a "Home" button and a dropdown menu with the buttons "Questions"
and "Resources".

There should be a button in the middle of the page with the text "Start Questions". Click on that button, and you
should see a page of true/false questions that will be geared towards whether you have the tendencies to be a compulsive gambler.
There will be true/false buttons for you to input your answers. Once you answer those questions, you should see a button at the bottom of
the page that says "turn in". Click on that button, and you should see a scale that rates your tendency to be a compulsive gambler,
along with some text feedback that gives you how likely you are to be a compulsive gambler.


The person's rating is on a scale of 0-9, with 9 being that you have the greatest tendency to be a compulsive gambler, and 0 being that you
have no tendency to be a compulsive gambler. There will also be colors associated with the ratings. If your rating was anywhere between 0-3, then
the color on your screen would be green, and it would indicate that you have a relatively low tendency to be a compulsive gambler. If your rating was anywhere
between 4-6, then the color on your screen would be yellow, and it would indicate that you have a relatively moderate tendency to be a compulsive gambler. If
your rating was anywhere between 7-9, then the color on your screen would be red, and it would indicate that you have a high tendency to be a compulsive gambler.

There will also be text feedback that elaborates on the rating you have received. If your rating was in the 0-3 range, then you would see a message that states
"Results: Healthy" with a smaller text stating "You are exhibiting safe behavior. Continuing to practice this behavior will help prevent substantially negative
outcomes." If your rating was in the 4-6 range, then you would see a message that states "Results: Moderately Unhealthy" with a smaller text stating "You are
exhibiting moderately unhealthy behavior. Continuing to practice this behavior will likely begin to provoke negative outcomes. "If your rating was in the 7-9
range, then you would see a message that states "Results: Unhealthy" with a smaller text stating "You are exhibiting unhealthy behavior. Continuing to practice
this behavior will begin to provoke negative outcomes."

If one happens to rate highly on the scale, and the feedback says that they are exhibitng unhealthy behavior, the person would see a sentence that says "Please refer
to our resources page to acquire help in changing your tendencies". There is a link there that would direct to a resources page, where there are links
that one could use to address their gambling addiction. There are two links on this page, with one page being a list of resources provided by the National Council
on Problem Gambling, whose mission is "to lead state and national stakeholders in the development of comprehensive policy and programs for all those affected by problem gambling."
The other link goes to Gamblers Anonymous, which is "a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their
common problem and help others to recover from a gambling problem."
For those who are still interested in accessing those resources, they would most likely be interested in the drop down menu at the top of the screen, where there is a button titled
"Resources". Once one clicks that resources button, they will be brought to resources page that was mentioned earlier. On that drop down menu is also a "Questions" button, which
is another way to access the questionnaire that was mentioned before.
